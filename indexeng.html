        Let me introduce myself, my name is Thomas, I'm 18 and I'm currently in my first year of telecommunication networks at the IUT in Colmar.
        I've just passed the STI2D baccalauréat (Science and Technology for Industry and Sustainable Development) with a major in maths, physics and Sin (Information and Digital Systems).

        Why network and telecommunications?

                What motivated me to take the telecommunication networks course at the IUT in Colmar was, of course, my interest in IT. Indeed, from a very early age, I was familiar with computer components and software. 
                This made me want to learn more.
            <br>
            <br>
            The second reason that made me want to join the Colmar iut was the quality of the premises and the teaching staff, which motivates students to work.
            <br>
            <br>
            By joining Unniversité, I already have a career plan mapped out in front of me, that of network administrator.
